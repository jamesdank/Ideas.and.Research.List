# Ideas.and.Research.List
This is a small PHP script that keeps track of ideas or things you want to research, it writes to a text file ideas.txt, to get the script to work just edit the path to the text file on line 28 and add the categories you want, I have a few in there as an example.  There is a space for an idea or something to research, only write in one, if you want to add more details you can pick a category but it will work without picking one.
